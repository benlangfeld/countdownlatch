  # Decrements the count of the latch, releasing all waiting threads if the count reaches zero.
  # * If the current count is greater than zero then it is decremented. If the new count is zero then all waiting threads are re-enabled for thread scheduling purposes.
  # * If the current count equals zero then nothing happens.

  # Causes the current thread to wait until the latch has counted down to zero, unless the thread is interrupted.
  # If the current count is zero then this method returns immediately.
  # If the current count is greater than zero then the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happen:
  # * The count reaches zero due to invocations of the countdown! method; or
  # * Some other thread interrupts the current thread; or
  # * The specified waiting time elapses.
  #
  # @param [Integer] timeout the maximum time to wait in seconds
  #
  # @return [Boolean] true if the count reached zero and false if the waiting time elapsed before the count reached zero
